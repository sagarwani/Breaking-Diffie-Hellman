1. A brute-force algorithm that simply tries every possibly x.
2. An implementation of the Pollard-rho or baby-step-giant-step algorithm. Both algorithms can be found in the HAC.

dl-brute <filename for inputs>.
On input a file containing decimal-formatted ( p; g; h ), prints x to standard output.
dl-efficient <filename for inputs>.
On input a file containing decimal-formatted ( p; g; h ), prints x to standard output.
